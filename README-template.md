## My process

I broke the challenge down into smaller parts, decided on the divs needed for the layout, completed the html then added the styling. Added the Javascript and then deployed to netlify once the basic functionality was down.


### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

Just because the layout looks good in chrome developer tools for mobile doesn't mean it is. Had an issue with the layout displaying incorrectly on my iphone, took a lot of googling and trial and error to fix but got there in the end.
